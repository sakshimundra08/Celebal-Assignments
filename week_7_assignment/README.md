This is the Weekâ€¯7 assignment for the Celebal Technologies Data Science program.

It predicts the **sentiment score** of a social media post based on metadata such as platform, post type, likes, comments, 
and shares using a **Random Forest Classifier**. The application is built using **Streamlit** and visualized with **Plotly**.



**Overview**

- Platform (e.g., Facebook, Twitter)
- Post type (image, video, etc.)
- Day of posting
- Engagement stats (likes, comments, shares)


**Built with:**

- Python, pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn (RandomForestClassifier)
- Streamlit for the UI
- Plotly for visualizations
